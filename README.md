#Smar Contract Tool

The goal of this tool is to aid in the development and testing of smart contracts by adding the ability to read already deployed EVM smart contract ABI and generate a Remix IDE-like UI for interacting with their public/external functions.This tool was developed with C# and Windows Forms as a desktop application. It works best with the Truffle + Ganache development environment.

#Required .NET 6

#How to use

The first thing is to set the appSetting.json 

  -set menemonic phrase

  -set network configuration. It may be local ganace, geth or a public node like Infura.

  -set default path to the folder of your compiled smart contract. This is usually found in the build folder of your Truffle project.

On first start, you should see an empty application.

If the mnemonic phrase is correct, you should see a dropdown with a bunch of different addresses that you can use to interact with the smart contracts. This is similar to the Remix. On address change, an ETH GetBalance request is sent to the blockchain, getting the current ETH balance of the user.

In #Contract Address# input, you should add the address of an already deployed smart contract and then press the upload button.

It will open the directory configured in the appSetting.json file, and you need to select the corresponding build json file, then press Save Contract.

That should save the contract in the application.

On contract selection, it will autogenerate all public/external methods from the loaded contract ABI in a remix lookalike way.

The method called "colors" is the following:

  -green for pure and view calls

  -orange for non payable calls that result in transactions.

  -red for payable functions

  

You can load as many contracts as you need. Every time you change the contract, the UI will be autogenerated again in order to work with the selected contract ABI

#Delete

You can delete all contracts, saved in the application by pressing the delete button.

#NB!

This application is under development. It works fine with most smart contract implementations, but some edge cases may not be implemented, so they may not work well.

The solidity supported version is 0.8.0 and new features of the latest solidity versions may not be supported.

Using this application is at your own risk! Using it with the ETH main net with real ETH is not recommended. The creator of this application should not be held responsible for any financial losses that may happen while using this application.
